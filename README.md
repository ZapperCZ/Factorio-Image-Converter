# Factorio Image Converter
This is a WIP tool designed to convert an image into Factorio map art<br/>
Any feedback is appreciated<br/>
## Instructions
1. Import the image you want to convert into Factorio map art
2. Convert the colors in the image into Factorio supported colors (currently has to be done manually, automated solution is being worked on)
3. Export your image
4. Copy the blueprint string and paste it into Factorio
## Info
Currently the imported image will be enlarged 4x, so I recommend that you use smaller images otherwise you will be met with long conversion times<br/>
I am currently working on implementing an image downscaling algorithm, so in the future even larger images might work, but this is not guaranteed<br/>
If you encounter any problems, or you might want to leave some feedback, please contact me on my Discord that can be found here on my profile<br/>
